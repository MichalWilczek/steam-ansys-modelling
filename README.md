Multi-dimensional quench velocity-based approach in ANSYS APDL and Python
(Copyright Â© 2020, CERN, Switzerland. All rights reserved.)

## Abstract
This repository presents the Python code for the multi-dimensional quench analysis with the quench-velocity based 
approach implemented in ANSYS APDL. The method was developed to simulate the longitudinal and the turn-to-turn quench 
propagation in high-order corrector magnets for the High-Luminosity LHC project. 

## Prerequisites
In order to run the script, the user should have the installed version of ANSYS APDL (version 2019 R1) and Python 3.6.

## Documentation
The code documentation is stored in the documentation folder with two files: (i) Quench_Based_Approach_in_ANSYS.pdf, 
(ii) Finite_Element_Analysis_of_Magneto_Thermal_Transient_Effects_in_Superconducting_Accelerator_Magnets.pdf. 
The first one describes step by step the usage of the code whereas the second one presents the theoretical background 
required to understand the quench velocity-based approach.
