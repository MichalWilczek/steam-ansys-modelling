## Prerequisites
In order to run the script, the user should have the installed version of ANSYS APDL

##### Initial Simulation Settings
The first part of configuration corresponds to definition of basic simulation settings. 
```json
{"analysis_settings": {
    "quench_init_position": 0.5,
    "quench_init_length": 0.1,
    "time_total_simulation": 0.4,
    "time_step_cosimulation": 0.01,
    "time_step_min_ansys": 1.0,
    "time_step_max_ansys": 10.0,
    "current_init": 100.0
    }}
```
Analysis settings definition is composed of:

 Argument | Units | Description 
 -------- | ----- | ----------- 
quench_init_position | m | Position of the centre of the initially quenched zone.
quench_init_length | m | Length of the initially quenched zone.
time_total_simulation | s | Total simulation time.
time_step_cosimulation | s | Time step after each of which the data is extracted from ANSYS. It is also a time slot for data exchange between ANSYS and quench velocity algorithm.
time_step_min_ansys | ms | Minimum time step applied within the automatic ANSYS time stepping algorithm. It must be smaller than the time_step_cosimulation.
time_step_max_ansys | ms | Maximum time step applied within the automatic ANSYS time stepping algorithm. It must be smaller than the time_step_cosimulation.
current_init | A | Initial current set in the analysis.

##### Temperature Distribution Settings
The user should decide what what type of temperature conditions will be applied in the analysis. There are two different types available: uniform and gaussian. 
```json
{"temperature_init_distribution": {
	"type": "gaussian",
	"input": {
		"temperature_init": 1.9, 
		"temperature_max_init_quenched_zone": 10.0, 
		"magnetic_field_initially_quenched_winding": 2.0}	
}}
```
Temperature distribution settings is composed of:

 Argument | Units | Description 
 -------- | ----- | ----------- 
 temperature_init | K | Initial temperature set outside of the initially quenched zone.
 temperature_max_init_quenched_zone | K | Maximum temperature set in the quenched zone.
 magnetic_field_initially_quenched_winding | T | Magnetic field value in the winding where the initial quench is triggered. This value is only required for the initial gaussian distribution whose borders of the quenched zone are at critical temperature dependent on the magnetic field strength.

The temperature_init_distribution requires different input depending on its type as described below: 

 Type | Required Input 
 ---- | --------------
 gaussian | temperature_init, temperature_max_init_quenched_zone
 uniform | temperature_init, temperature_max_init_quenched_zone, magnetic_field_initially_quenched_winding

##### Analysis Type Settings
The programme is written in order to perform one- and multidimensional analysis based on quench velocity algorithm as well
as to conduct one-dimensional heat-balance equation-based analyses for mapping purposed. Therefore, the analysis type should be 
specified as follows:
```json
{"analysis_type": {
	"type": "quench_velocity",
	"input": {
		"v_quench_model": "numerical", 
		"electric_ansys_elements": true}
		}
}
```
Analysis type settings are composed of:



The user the options for the analysis of the electric circuit
```json
{"circuit_settings": {
    "build_electric_circuit": false,
    "input": {"transient_electric_analysis": false}
	}
}
```

The user should choose material properties
```json
{"material_properties_settings": {
    "type": "nonlinear",
    "input": {
        "f_cu_f_nbti": 2.2, 
        "rrr": 193.0, 
        "material_properties_directory": "C:\\gitlab\\steam-ansys-modelling\\Material_Properties"}
	}
}
```

The user magnetic field
```json
{"magnetic_field_settings": {
	"magnetic_map_model": "2D_static",
	"input": {"magnetic_field_map_plot": false}
	}
}
```

The user should define geometry creation...
```json
{"geometry_settings": {
	"geometry_type": {
		"type": "skew_quadrupole",
		"dimensionality": "multiple_1D",
		"type_input": {
            "strand_diameter": 0.7, 
            "winding_side": 0.941, 
            "coil_long_side": 413.21, 
            "coil_short_side": 126.81, 
            "coil_initial_radius": 9.15, 
            "number_turns_in_layer": 29,
            "insulation_analysis": true,
            "winding_number_first_in_analysis": 233,
            "winding_number_last_in_first_layer": 234,
            "number_of_layers_in_analysis": 2},
        "mesh_input": {
            "division_long_side": 100, 
            "division_short_side": 30, 
            "division_radius": 5},
        "dimensionality_input": {}
		}
	}
}
```
